## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Arch-based Linux distribution**: Confix is specifically designed for Arch-based distributions.
- **yay**: Confix utilizes `yay` as the package manager for installing and managing packages.
- **JSON configuration file**: You need a valid JSON configuration file located at `~/.config/confix/packages.json` that lists the packages you want Confix to manage.

## Dependencies

Confix requires the following dependencies to be installed on your system:

- `jsoncpp`: A C++ library for handling JSON data.
- `argparse`: A command-line argument parsing library.

You can install these dependencies on Arch-based systems using the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm jsoncpp argparse
```
> If you are using nix then it pretty easy to install dependencies and build the project. use `nix build` to build the project and the binary will be avilable for you in the `result/bin/confix` you can run that binary with `nix run`

## Installation

1. Clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srinath10X/Confix.git
```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd Confix
```

3. Compile the source and Install confix :

```bash
make install
```

4. Ensure your local bin directory is in your PATH (if not already):

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run Confix from the terminal:

```bash
confix
```

Confix will read the configuration file (`~/.config/confix/packages.json` or `~/.config/confix/packages.jsonc`), check for the specified packages, and install any that are missing.

## Configuration

Ensure your configuration file (`~/.config/confix/packages.json` or `~/.config/confix/packages.jsoc`) follows this structure:

```json
{
	"packages": [
		"package1",
		"package2",
		"package3",
		"package4",
		"....",
		"packageN"
	]
}
```

List all the packages you want Confix to manage under the `"packages"` array.
